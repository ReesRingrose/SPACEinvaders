OOP Assingment space invaders 


Aim of the game :

the aim of the game is to get a high score just like in the actual 
space invaders . everytime you kill all the aliens they increment down 
another level and they will keep in crementing until you die so the aim of the 
game is to get a high a score as possible 


controls how to play the game :

first you use your mouse to move your ship it is fixed in place but you can move it 
from side to side 

secondly you can click your mouse to shoot bullets at the aliens if an alien
is hit with a bullet it explodes 

if you get hit with a bomb you die and so avoid the bombs at all time
