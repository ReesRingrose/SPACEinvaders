OOP Assingment space invaders 


Aim of the game :

the aim of the game is to get a high score just like in the actual 
space invaders . everytime you kill all the aliens they increment down 
another level and they will keep in crementing until you die so the aim of the 
game is to get a high a score as possible 


controls how to play the game :

first you use your mouse to move your ship it is fixed in place but you can move it 
from side to side 

secondly you can click your mouse to shoot bullets at the aliens if an alien
is hit with a bullet it explodes 

if you get hit with a bomb you die and so avoid the bombs at all time 


tips: be careful when you kill all the aliens because they will apear automatically
and very quickly if you are not ready you could be trapped under a wall of bullets
and die 

you can shoot bullets and destroy them don't always feel like you have to move
out of the way all the time


if i could redo the assignment what would i do :
i would incorporate i menu in the game this is the only think i would 
add in if i could redo the assignment as i ran out of time towards the 
end it would have made the assignment way more aesthetically pleasing
